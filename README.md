# CaptalOne Web Application Submission

This is my submission for CapitalOne's coding challenge for the software engineering summit of 2017.

## First Repository

My first repository which entails the files pretaining to the CapitalOne coding challenge.

```sh
Please create the following: 

Deployed web application - Website URL and the supporting Github repository.

The application must use Yelp's Fusion API. You can use other public APIs as required.
```

## The Process

This is my first web application and first time using git. My experience has been very interesting and confusing
but educational and fun at the same time. I will continue to learn and build upon my knowledge of web applications,
Javascript and front end coding.
