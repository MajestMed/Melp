# CaptalOne Web Application Submission

This is my submission for CapitalOne's coding challenge for the software engineering summit of 2017.

## First Repository

My first repository which entails the files pretaining to the CapitalOne coding challenge.

```sh
Please create the following: 

Deployed web application - Website URL and the supporting Github repository.

The application must use Yelp's Fusion API. You can use other public APIs as required.
```

## Description

The point of this web application is to add some spontanouity in our food lives. All my friends, including myself, have a problem of
trying to find a new place to eat, but we just end up going to the same place. This web application generates a random number 1-100 
(amount of results on the yelp page), and gives you 4 areas in Virginia to choose from. These are the main areas I visit in Virginia
and also the most populated areas with too many places to choose from. Once the random number is generated, the user should keep that
number in mind and click the location of where they will be visiting. They should then navigate to that number ex. 13 (Page 2,item 13)
and go to that reasturant to try something new. This will allow you to explore the area, find new delicious hidden reasturants all while
trying new things. How Spontaneous!


## The Process

This is my first web application and first time using git. My experience has been very interesting and confusing
but educational and fun at the same time. I will continue to learn and build upon my knowledge of web applications,
Javascript and front end coding.
